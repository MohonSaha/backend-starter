## Explain version-1.1 Codes

### Next()

1. We can see that we have to handle err every time from catch block in every controller file in the project. We can handle this error very easily through the express mechanims named next()
2. If we give anything into next() in express application it treated as error. And next() pass it to global error handler.
3. Global error handler is a error handling middleware. And is have 4 parameters named: req, res, err, next.
4. Controller catch block => next() => global error handler

### Not Found (middleware)

1. If we give a wrong api then express gives us a html template formate error. We use this middleware to convert that html formet into json formet. It takes 3 parameters like a normal middleware.

### sendResponse utility function

1. We have to use response from the try catch block in controller.ts file. That's why our code repeatation increases gradually. So we can easily create a common reuseable function for that called utility function. And we can call it from the controller.ts file and send out required data.

### Index Route

1. This just a refactoring of application routes. This refactoring will help us to manage multiple routes and clean code in app.ts. Actually it will also help us to manage the route in modular pattern.
