## Explain version-1.1 Codes

### Next()

1. We can see that we have to handle err every time from catch block in every controller file in the project. We can handle this error very easily through the express mechanims named next()
2. If we give anything into next() in express application it treated as error. And next() pass it to global error handler.
3. Global error handler is a error handling middleware. And is have 4 parameters named: req, res, err, next.
4. Controller catch block => next() => global error handler
